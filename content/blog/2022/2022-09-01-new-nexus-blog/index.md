This is a completely new blog about Nexus.



## Summary

The launch of Nexus on mainnet is a major milestone for interoperability on ICON. Starting today, dApps like Balanced, PancakeSwap, Omm, and more will be able to leverage ICON Bridge for cross-chain DeFi between ICON and BSC in a production setting. Over the coming months, we will continue refining the Nexus user interface and working with the ICON Bridge team to support additional blockchains for cross-chain token transfers. If you have any questions or comments about Nexus, feel free to [start a discussion on the ICON Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7a75Hf3cFm).
